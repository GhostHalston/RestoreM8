# RestoreM8

 The all in one app to downgrade apple devices with shsh2 blobs (Using the CheckM8 exploit)
 
# Supported Devices:

All iPhones with the A7-A11 Prescessor

All iPads with the A7-A11 Processor

# Future Plans:

I would like to have FutureRestore-Script Built in to the app later down the road.

# NOTE!

This will restore your device all you your data will be wiped!

Make sure the SEP and Baseband are compatible.

# Important Info

If you want to restore without setting your nonce with halo michael's repo you can use uncover since it does the same thing.
